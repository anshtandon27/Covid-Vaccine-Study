# Covid-Vaccine-Study

## Causal Question:
Does receiving the COVID-19 vaccine reduce the likelihood of hospitalisation due to COVID-related complications in adults aged 65 and older?

## Considering Confounders:
- Age and Health Status: The general health of an individual and their age can significantly impact their susceptibility to COVID-19 and the likelihood of hospitalisation.
- Vaccination History: Previous COVID vaccinations could influence the effectiveness of the current vaccine.
- Access to Healthcare: Socioeconomic status and access to healthcare facilities may affect both vaccination rates and the likelihood of hospitalisation.
- Comorbidities: The presence of other health conditions (e.g., heart disease, diabetes) can increase the risk of severe complications from COVID-19.
- Behavioural Factors: Hygiene practices, travel habits, and exposure to crowded places can influence COVID transmission and severity.
- Geographical Location: The prevalence of the COVID-19 virus can vary by region and impact infection rates.

Correction Strategy:
Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT): Conduct a randomised study where individuals are randomly assigned to receive the COVID vaccine or a placebo. This can help control for known and unknown confounders.

## Unmeasured Confounders:
- Genetic Predispositions: Certain genetic factors may affect an individual's susceptibility to COVID-19 and its severity.
- Immune System Response: Variations in the immune response to the vaccine may play a role in outcomes.
- Household Composition: Living with young children or elderly individuals could affect COVID exposure and transmission.

## Considering Colliders:

In the context of our COVID vaccine study, the potential collider identified is:

COVID Testing Rates*

This variable is influenced by both the exposure and the outcome. Individuals who receive the COVID-19 vaccine might be more likely to get tested for COVID if they experience COVID-like symptoms, thinking they are protected. On the other hand, unvaccinated individuals who develop COVID-like symptoms might not get tested as frequently because they may attribute their symptoms to a common cold.

## How this causal question can drive policy changes:

In the case of our COVID vaccine study, if it demonstrates a significant reduction in hospitalisations among vaccinated individuals, it could have several policy implications:

- Targeted Vaccination Campaigns: Public health agencies could implement targeted vaccination campaigns, especially focusing on adults aged 65 and older, to increase vaccination rates in this high-risk group.
- Subsidies and Accessibility: Governments may consider offering subsidies or free COVID-19 vaccines to encourage higher vaccination rates, particularly among older adults who may face financial barriers.
- Education and Awareness: Policy efforts could include education and awareness programmes to inform the public about the benefits of COVID-19 vaccination, especially for older adults who are more vulnerable to severe complications.
- Healthcare Provider Recommendations: Encouraging healthcare providers to strongly recommend and provide information about COVID vaccination to their older patients could be part of policy strategies.
- Surveillance and Response: Policy could also involve strengthening surveillance systems to monitor COVID cases and hospitalisations, allowing for more timely and targeted responses during COVID outbreaks.

By demonstrating a causal link between COVID-19 vaccination and reduced hospitalisations, the study could provide strong evidence to support these policy initiatives, ultimately leading to better public health outcomes for older adults.


## Abstract
Real-world evidence is critical to evaluate COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness against hospitalization after mass vaccination campaigns. This study analyzed hospitalization rates by vaccination status in adults 65-79 years using population-level data. Public health surveillance data on COVID-19 outcomes and vaccination were analyzed for adults aged 65-79 years over 96 weeks (2021-2023). Weekly hospitalization rates were calculated and compared between unvaccinated (n=38,188-47,760 per week) and vaccinated groups (n=345,132-436,039 per week) using t-tests. The unvaccinated group had a significantly higher mean hospitalization rate (0.000477) compared to the vaccinated group (0.000188) (p<0.05), representing a 60-70% rate reduction. The restricted age range minimizes confounding. Real-world evidence confirms COVID-19 vaccination substantially reduces hospitalization risk in adults 65-79 years old, aligning with clinical trial efficacy. These findings validate the public health impact of vaccination against severe COVID-19 outcomes in this high-risk population. Continued surveillance is needed to monitor effectiveness against emerging variants.
