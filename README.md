# Flu-Vaccine-Study

## Causal Question:
Does receiving the flu vaccine reduce the likelihood of hospitalization due to flu-related complications in adults aged 65 and older?

## Considering Confounders:
- Age and Health Status: The general health of an individual and their age can significantly impact their susceptibility to the flu and the likelihood of hospitalization.
- Vaccination History: Previous flu vaccinations could influence the effectiveness of the current vaccine.
- Access to Healthcare: Socioeconomic status and access to healthcare facilities may affect both vaccination rates and the likelihood of hospitalization.
- Comorbidities: Presence of other health conditions (e.g., heart disease, diabetes) can increase the risk of severe complications from the flu.
- Behavioral Factors: Hygiene practices, travel habits, and exposure to crowded places can influence flu transmission and severity.
- Geographical Location: The prevalence of the flu virus can vary by region and impact infection rates.

Correction Strategy:
Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT): Conduct a randomized study where individuals are randomly assigned to receive the flu vaccine or a placebo. This can help control for known and unknown confounders.

## Unmeasured Confounders:
- Genetic Predispositions: Certain genetic factors may affect an individual's susceptibility to the flu and its severity.
- Immune System Response: Variations in immune response to the vaccine may play a role in outcomes.
- Household Composition: Living with young children or elderly individuals could affect flu exposure and transmission.
